### Part 1: Introduction to CSS3

#### 1.1 What is CSS3?
CSS3, or Cascading Style Sheets Level 3, is the latest version of the stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS3 introduces new features and enhancements, allowing web developers to apply styles more efficiently and creatively, such as rounded corners, gradients, animations, and more.

#### 1.2 Separation of Concerns
The separation of concerns is a fundamental principle in web development that involves keeping different aspects of a web page, such as content (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript), separate. HTML is responsible for structuring and organizing content, while CSS is used for styling and presentation. This separation makes code more modular, maintainable, and easier to collaborate on within development teams.

### Part 2: Styling HTML Elements

#### 2.1 Create a New HTML File (index.html)
This HTML file sets up a basic structure for the webpage, including a title, a heading (`<h1>`), and a paragraph (`<p>`). It also links to an external CSS file named "styles.css."

#### 2.2 Linking CSS (styles.css)
The linked CSS file contains basic styling for the `<h1>` and `<p>` elements, changing their colors, font sizes, and adding a background color to paragraphs. It also includes a CSS comment.

### Part 3: Selectors and Properties

#### 3.1 CSS Selectors and Applying Styles (styles.css)
This section introduces additional styles using different CSS selectors. It styles all `<h2>` elements with a red color, applies bold font weight to elements with the class "special-text," and centers the text for an element with the ID "unique-paragraph."

### Part 4: Advanced Styling

#### 4.1 Text Styling and Backgrounds (styles.css)
Advanced styling includes setting the font family for the entire document, giving the body a background color, and adding a border with padding and margin to a container element.

### Part 5: Recap and Assignment

#### 5.1 Assignment (styles.css)
The assignment introduces a responsive design concept using a media query. When the screen width is less than or equal to 600 pixels, the font size of the entire document is adjusted to 14 pixels, enhancing the webpage's responsiveness on smaller screens.
